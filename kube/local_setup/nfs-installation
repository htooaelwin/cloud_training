Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to share directories over a network. With NFS, you can mount remote directories on your system and work with the files on the remote machine as if they were local files.

Here are the steps to install NFS on Ubuntu and mount an NFS share.

**On the NFS Server:**

1. **Install NFS server packages.**

    Open a terminal and execute the following command to install the NFS Kernel Server:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
    ```

2. **Create the directory to be shared.**

    Next, you will need to create a directory to be shared with the client machines. You can create it anywhere, but in this example, we'll create it in the `/mnt` directory.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /mnt/sharedfolder
    ```

    Change `sharedfolder` to the name you prefer.

3. **Assign server access to client(s).**

    Edit the `/etc/exports` file to specify the directory to be shared and the details of the clients allowed to access it.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/exports
    ```

    Add a new line to the file, with the format `<directory> <client>(<options>)`, replacing `<directory>`, `<client>`, and `<options>` with your own details. For example:

    ```bash
    /mnt/sharedfolder 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
    ```

    This line means: the directory `/mnt/sharedfolder` is accessible to clients on the 192.168.1.0/24 network, with read/write access. The options `sync` and `no_subtree_check` improve the reliability of the connection.

4. **Export the shared directory.**

    After you've set up the `/etc/exports` file, you can make the server export the shared directories with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo exportfs -a
    ```

5. **Ensure the NFS service is running.**

    Finally, restart the NFS Kernel Server to make sure everything runs correctly:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
    ```

**On the NFS Client:**

1. **Install NFS client packages.**

    Open a terminal and execute the following command to install the necessary NFS client packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nfs-common
    ```

2. **Create a mount point for the NFS host's shared directory.**

    You need a directory to serve as the "mount point" for the NFS shared directory. You can create this anywhere, but in this example, we'll create it in the `/mnt` directory.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /mnt/sharedfolder
    ```

    Again, change `sharedfolder` to the name you prefer.

3. **Mount the NFS shared directory.**

    Now you can mount the NFS shared directory from the server to your client machine's mount point with this command:

    ```bash
    sudo mount -t nfs <nfs-server-ip>:/mnt/sharedfolder /mnt/sharedfolder
    ```

    Replace `<nfs-server-ip>` with the IP address of the NFS server.

4. **Check the mounted NFS share.**

    You can confirm that the NFS share has been correctly mounted with the `df -h` command:

    ```bash
    df -h
    ```

Remember to replace the IP address, directory paths, and names according to your setup. The `/mnt/sharedfolder` directory and the `192.168.1.0/24` network
