To configure MetalLB using a ConfigMap, you need to create a YAML file that defines the desired configuration. Here's an example of a MetalLB configuration file that uses layer 2 mode and assigns IP addresses from a specified address pool:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config
  namespace: metallb-system
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200
```

This configuration defines a single address pool named `default` that uses the Layer 2 mode for ARP/NDP-based IP address assignment. The `addresses` field specifies the range of IP addresses that MetalLB can assign to services of type `LoadBalancer`.

You can customize this configuration to suit your needs. For example, you can add more address pools or change the protocol to `bgp` for BGP-based IP assignment. Here's an example of a configuration that uses BGP mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config
  namespace: metallb-system
data:
  config: |
    peers:
    - my-asn: 64512
      peer-asn: 64512
      peer-address: 10.0.0.1
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: bgp
      addresses:
      - 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200
```

In this example, the configuration defines a BGP peering session with a BGP router at IP address `10.0.0.1` and uses the same Autonomous System Number (ASN) of `64512` for both the local and peer ASNs. The address pool configuration is the same as in the previous example.

To apply this configuration to your cluster, save it to a file named `metallb-config.yaml`, and use `kubectl` to create the ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl apply -f metallb-config.yaml
```

Once the configuration is applied, MetalLB will use the specified settings for IP address assignment and protocol.

Remember to update the address ranges and other settings according to your network requirements, and ensure that your infrastructure supports the chosen mode (Layer 2 or BGP).
